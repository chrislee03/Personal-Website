                    My name is Christopher Lee and I am a junior at UC Berkeley studying Data Science with a concentration in Economics. I’m from Los Angeles, California and I’ve grown up there my entire life.  I am an aspiring Product Manager with the hopes of creating a product that leaves an impact on this world. When I’m not trying to break into product, you’ll find me side questing as a wannabe full stack developer

                    As a project manager for <a href="https://product.studentorg.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"> Product Space </a>, a student run organization focused on product management, I’m currently leading a project for The Coca Cola Company, focused on reducing their carbon footprint. I’ve also been a part of client teams for both Meta and Samsung. Through these opportunities to get hands on industry experience with product, I’ve discovered my passion to pursue product as a career. I've previously interned at a fintech startup as a product management intern.

                <div>
                    Some of my hobbies include following the Los Angeles Lakers (glazing LeBron), playing pick up basketball with my friends at the RSF, playing some family friend poker, and lifting weights with my little in Product Space. I’m also sad to say that one of my most frequent hobbies is also going to Moffitt Library (RIP being a Berkeley student). Besides that, I love hanging out with my friends and meeting new people so feel free to reach out :)
